I am currently an Associate Professor with School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, China. I received the B.S. degree (with the highest honor) in 2009 and Ph.D. degree (with the highest honor) in 2016, both from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China. Then I worked as a Post-Doc, and later become an Associate Professor in Beijing Institute of Technology. From 2013 to 2015 and from 2018 to 2019, I was a visiting researcher with the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.<br />

<br />

I was the recipient of two Excellent Ph.D. Thesis Awards from both the Chinese Institute of Electronics and the Beijing Institute of Technology in 2016. I was also the recipient of Second-Class Prize of the National Award for Technological Invention in 2020, the First-Class Prize of the Science and Technology (Technological Invention) Award from Chinese Institute of Electronics in 2018, and the Second-Class Prize of the Ministerial Level Science and Technology Progress Award in 2014. <br />

<br />

I have more than 10 years of professional experience in system and algorithm design, implementation (through FPGA and DSP), and debugging. I have received three Science and Technology Progress Awards and hold more than 20 patents. <br />
